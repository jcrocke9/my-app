<p>Scan the list of "Towns in District" and see if you know people who live there.  Should you have a connection to any of these districts (like local friends or family), *reach out* and make sure those connections are ready to vote in November.  Maybe you could help your local connections host an event or otherwise support and encourage their actions.  And go spend a few weekends with them, knocking on doors or volunteering at a local campaign office - it makes a difference!</p>
<p>Regardless if you have a prior connection to a district, you can still make a personal connection to a Democratic candidate and a campaign.  All of these campaigns would *love* for you to help them.  Watch their biographical videos, read about them - they are amazing!  And they need money, they need canvassers, they need cheerleaders.  Adopt one and help us all in the effort to flip the House!</p>
<p>"If what you are doing requires no sacrifice at all, then you can do more. If you are one of these folks who is watching cable news at your cocktail parties with your friends and you are saying 'civilization is collapsing' and you are nervous and worried, but that is not where you are putting all your time, energy and money, then either you don't actually think civilization is collapsing ... or you are not pushing yourself hard enough and I would push harder." - President Obama, June 2018</p>
<p>Apart from the campaigns themselves, there are many ways to connect to more organized groups:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Swing Left, focused on swing districts with detailed guides on how to pitch in. Put in an address to find (or host) ongoing events, join local google groups, etc.  Sign up for their pledges, ongoing initiatives and grassroots activities! https://swingleft.org/ </li>
<li>Indivisible - national movement to resist Trump, please join a local chapter to stay engaged and informed on legislative priorities!  While many hey have also set up a great system for phone bank opportunities to all competitive senate races. https://www.indivisible.org/ </li>
<li>Virginia Grassroots - coalition of local groups by district in Virginia. Very effective for get out the vote efforts in 2017 - be sure to check out the individual groups http://virginiagrassroots.org/vgr-organizations.php and http://virginiagrassroots.org/index.php </li>
<li><a href="http://www.bluewavenj.org">Blue Wave NJ</a> - sign up for specific canvassing dates through their website</li>
<li>Turn PA Blue - sign up for phone banking, canvassing, *hosting* canvassers etc. https://turnpablue.org/take-action/phone-banking/ </li>
<li>Mobilize America, a platform used by many campaigns to organize events. Search by day or within a distance of a zip code https://events.mobilizeamerica.io/ </li>
<li>Red2Blue, a national organization mobilizes volunteers and connects them to campaigns to elect Democratic candidates at all levels. Especially good for those who don’t want to canvass. https://red2blue.org/ </li>
<li>Sister District Project organizes volunteers into local teams to win state elections for Democrats. They "sister" this deep blue capacity with swing districts to support strategic state races that matter. https://www.sisterdistrict.com/ </li>
<li>Of course the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee itself https://dccc.org/ </li>
<li>nbsp;nbsp;...your local progressive organization (unions, environmental, social justice, women's health, disability rights, etc.) is hopefully organizing too.  Because if we don’t flip the House, everything we care about is so so so much harder to defend.</li>
 </ul>
